This code is intended to use for mass balance calculations on glaciers.
Input needed:
* a raster file of the glacier with the elevation values of various years (extracted from DEM, DTM, etc)
* pixel amount
* pixel size

Mass balance estimations are given in m.w.e. (meter water equivalent)
Lake level estimations are given in mm. above lake level (Argentino Lake, Santa Cruz)
